I designed and implemented a database for bird-watchers. The database contains birds, each of which has a name (string) and a name in Latin (string). The database also counts the observations of each bird.

The program has the following commands:

Add - adds a bird Observation - adds an observation All - prints all birds One - prints one bird Quit - ends the program

Incorrect input will also be handled.
